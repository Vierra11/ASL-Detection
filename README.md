# American Sign Language Detection

This repository contains a project focused on American Sign Language (ASL) detection using computer vision, machine learning, neural networks, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

## Overview

American Sign Language is a vital means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project aims to facilitate communication by developing a system that can interpret ASL gestures using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Real-time ASL gesture detection using computer vision.
- Integration of machine learning models for accurate recognition.
- Utilization of neural networks for gesture classification.
- Implementation of OpenCV for image and video processing.
- Integration with MediaPipe for hand landmark estimation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow (or any other suitable machine learning framework)
